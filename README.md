# Soldier_Suicide_Prevention

This is a personal passion project revolving around the reports that between 20 and 22 veterans commit suicide every day.

I grew up in San Antonio, TX and was on my way to the MCRC before a family event stopped me in my tracks.  Since then, I have always held the men and women of our Armed Forces in high regard, and find it downright unjust that they - or any first responder - intentionally *volunteer* to fight outside evils only to succomb to one that is inside.  

Suicide itself is a complex issue, involving both psychological and physiological disturbances only understood by the person contemplating it as a possibility.  The aim of this research is to see what story the data tells, and what (if any) patterns can be observed before such a family trauma takes place.
